  This file is included at run time by matching a pattern specified in 
  application.properties. The name is not significant, so long as it
  matches the pattern.

  Tokens of the form {{xxx.yyy}} can be used as placeholders, and will
  be substituted from values in application.properties, or from 
  environment variables.

  In this particular application, however, the Camel routes are defined in
  Java, so this file is not used.
